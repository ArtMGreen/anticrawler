To run the entire app using Docker, just run this command in terminal: `docker compose up`.

To run the app locally:
1. Install the requirements listed in `requirements.txt`.
2. Run the backend app `main.py`.
3. Run the frontend app through this command: `streamlit run app.py --server.port=8501`.

In both cases, the app will be accessible through your browser at `localhost:8501`.
